# Social Robot

Welcome to the repository for the [Robotics Club at UCFs](http://robotics.ucf.edu/) upcoming [social robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_robot) project. 

The goals of this robot are:

* Create a socially assistive robot to operate in hospitals
* Advance the field of social robotics
* Provide undergraduates and graduates with experience in an area of robotics not often included in the collegiate experience

Due to the complexity of this robot the code is divided into the following sections:

* Affective Intelligence
* Computer Vision
* Control
* Decision Making
* Dialogue Management
* Haptic Feedback
* Knowledge Management
* Learning
* Simulation
* Resources
