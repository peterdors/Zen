This folder is where vision demos should go. 

Your code should be commented before posting here. At the very least you should comment anything you got from a website such as stack overflow, any algorithm you created or any non obvious uses of third party functions.  I personaly like documenting every unit of code (think discrete functions). You do not need a comment for every line especially if its only
an OpenCV function call. The ultimate goal is to get you in the habit of commenting in a consistent mannger.

You should also create a readme.md file like this one including (you don't need to use Markdown for styling but if you know it feel free to):

**Description of the Codes Functionality:** What does your code do? Does it detect faces? Shapes? Some kind of object?

**Overall Algorithmic Approach:** This could be Haar Caascades or Thresholding and Contourng or anything else. Try your best here. Tell me what you think you used.

**How to run your code:** This should contain any command line arguments or datasets that need to be present for your code to work.

**Limitations (Optional):** If you've noticed limitations in your code mention them here. This is only for things you've noticed. I'm not yet expecting
thorough testing to try to break your code. Possible limitations could include things like faces not being detected if not more or less
straight or color thresholding failing in certain lighting conditions

**Improvements (Optional):** This again isn't necessary right now if you haven't thought of this but if you have ideas on how to improve your code in the future feel free to share them here.
